                          <em>Verification Process:</em> We are required by law
                          to verify the identities of those who submit requests
                          to know or to delete. To determine whether the
                          individual making the request is the consumer about
                          whom we have collected information, we will verify
                          your identity by matching the identifying information
                          provided by you in the request to the Personal
                          Information that we already maintain about you. As a
                          part of this process, you will be required to provide
                          your name and email address, and mobile number (if the
                          same have been voluntarily provided by you at the time

                              Information, we may deny the request. If the
                              request is denied in whole or in part for this
                              reason, we will provide a copy of, or direct you

                              making the request for specific pieces of Personal
                              Information, we are prohibited from disclosing any
                              specific pieces of Personal Information to the

                              for this reason, we will evaluate the request as
                              if it is seeking the disclosure of categories of
                              Personal Information about the consumer.

                          you to: (1) provide the authorized agent with signed
                          permission to do so; (2) verify your identity directly
                          with us; and (3) directly confirm with us that you
                          provided the authorized agent permission to submit the
                          request. However, we will not require these actions if

                          the request and notify the User of the reason for
                          refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount
                          will be based upon the administrative costs of
